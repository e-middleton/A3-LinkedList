## Reflection

What do you see as the benefits and downsides of working with linked lists instead of arrays? When might they be most useful versus limiting?
Linked lists are more useful for when elements are being inserted and deleted, but they are more costly when an item needs to be accessed. For transfer style, they seem more useful for splicing and extracting, but if the method is a copy method, it does noto save time compared to using an array implementation because they both require looping through the elements.


What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
Figuring out how to have the pointer of the Iterator class where it was supposed to be.


What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
I feel like I have a more complete view of the different options for implementation of something that seems similar on the user end.


note: there is no way to include an informative error message in the exceptions.
